## Description

This is a collection of headphone holders in different sizes for [Multiboard](https://www.multiboard.io/) Pegboard or [Multipoint](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multipoint/multipoints).

Note that you have more options if you use the Multipoint version with rail slots. This can be particularly useful if you want to use the holder in a different place later.

The pegboard click version requires less printing time and is less stable.

The very large versions may be used to hang two headphones on one holder. It's strongly recommended to use the rail slot version for better stability.

In general: The larger the headphone holder, the more likely you should use the rail slot version.

## Contribution

There are two ways for contribution:

1. Request other headphone holder dimensions via GitHub and [open an issue](https://github.com/IOIO72/multiboard-pegboard-headphone-holder/issues/new/choose).
2. Generate the headphone holders yourself via [Multiboard Headphone Holders For Multipoint Or Pegboard](https://github.com/IOIO72/multiboard-pegboard-headphone-holder).

The reason why I do not publish a customizer on MakerWorld is the license of the required file *Lite Multipoint Rail - Negative.stl* and *Pegboard Click.stl*, which you have to download yourself.
